# Dev Environment

- Install all necessary packages with `npm install`
- Install Tailwind from `https://tailwindcss.com/`
- Run Tailwind builder with `npm run tw`
- See live preview of theme with `shopify theme dev` (make sure Shopify CLI is installed)
- Tailwind is used for development. All liquid files are included as per the `tailwind-config.js` and are Tailwind classes are _prefixed_ with **twcss-**, for example the `flex` class becomes `twcss-flex` to avoid overwriting Dawn's default styles. For responsive design, prefix as follows: `md:twcss-flex`

# Git issues

- There's an unfixed issue with Git for this project. There's a Git Actions workflow set up to generate the app.css file after a commit has been pushed. This usually causes conflicts with the `app.css` file. To resolve this conflict and be able to fetch/pull the newer versions you must simply delete the `app.css` file from local and pull it from the remote branch. The `app.css` file is auto-generated from other files so it will not be a breaking change

# Old files

- There's a couple `legacy` files in the theme dir that are actually just copy-pasted sections from the previous theme
- This is important to note because some of these sections might not be very well optimized and might need to be upgraded in the future
- These sections I've prefixed the name with `old_*`, for example the section `old_cart-discounts.liquid` is copied from the previous theme. This file might depend on other old assets which are also prefixed with `old_*` so they're easily identifiable and can be replaced with newer versions in the future
- Replacing them is not necessary from the get-go and might just be an avoidable task; the main focus should be rebuilding Shogun pages first

# New files

- For non-default-theme files, be it either sections or assets I've created after downloading this theme, I've always prefixed with `steelmonks-*` or `sm-*`, for example `sm-parallax-1a.liquid` is a snippet I've made for the colorful titles on the homepage (could not think of a better way to do it than 'hardcoding' it. This method also has translations in mind).
- This prefixing keeps theme clutter to a minimum as we can quickly identify the new files. The sections themselves can be named anything so they don't need the prefix, e.g. naming `steelmonks-parallax.liquid` `Parallax Section` for the user as it is less relevant developer-wise and easier on the user

## Translations

### This is an outline of how the translations should be handled if you _don't want_ to use a translation app

- Complete the move away from Shogun by rebuilding all Shogun pages into Shopify by following the guidelines **from above** by respecting the file-naming system by prefixing new files with `sm` or `steelmonks`; doesn't matter which one, they both do their job just as good and will help development, including most assets except generic assets, such as `cross-icon.liquid` or `minus-icon.liquid`; mostly just icons
- For the rest of the development rules - there's not really any! Build the pages as you best see fit as long as they're created with semantically meaningful HTML (`section`, `article`, `ul`, `a` VS `div`, `span`, etc.)

### This is an outline of how the translations should be handled if you _do want_ to use a translation app

- Use the translation app after moving away from Shogun as page builder sections are usually tricky to get detected and translated by an app automatically
- Make sure to avoid the type of sections or snippets such as `sm-parallax-1a.liquid` where there's a funky text of multiple font sizes and colors in an irregular pattern as this will be a pain to translate (see above point)
- Try to keep the sections' texts as settings so the user can change it easily and for it to be translated by the app properly
- Hardcoded texts will be translated, but not always. For criteria, I'm not sure, but it looks like non page-builder pages are more likely to be translated by an app than Shogun pages

## Neat tricks

- You can use metafields `{{ product.metafields }}` to output things conditionally `{%- if product.metafields contains "abc" %} class="blue" {% endif -%}`
- You can output any variable you assign with `{% assign my_variable = "variable_name" %}`. Example in `header-mega-menu.liquid`
  - Variable types (you'll most likely only use string, number and boolean, but still useful to know): https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/types/
  - Use the previous documentation to find official technical information

## Random intel

- Text highlighting in the header (blue to black gradient) happens thanks to the `--highlighted` class, added conditionally using liquid code that looks for the string `--highlighted` in the link's name and adds the class. See `header-mega-menu.liquid` for the approach. You can add this class anywhere to highlight anything the same way
